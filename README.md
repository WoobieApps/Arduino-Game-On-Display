# Arduino-Game-On-Display
Project for university course of real time programming

Main goal of this project is to create an app for Arduino board that will use OLED display as user interface. User will be able to generate input signals with tact switches 

# Stack
- Arduino Uno board as HW
- Arduino IDE (C)
- Wokwi Arduino simulator (for tests)

# Architecture TODO
